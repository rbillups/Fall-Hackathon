# Hackathon
Challenge: The Connected World is the state of existence where everything is becoming increasingly
digitized and globalized. This means workplaces, healthcare, transportation, schools, personal
devices, and home fixtures are increasing interconnected. As a result, the world is becoming rich
with digital assets (e.g. data, APIs, statistics, imagery, etc.). We believe there is great opportunity to
enrich the human experience based on interconnecting objects in the Connected World using logic
and cool technology. We are challenging you to use your innovative spirit and your technological
expertise to help integrate the human experience with the digital experience.
Your mission is to help people thrive by making the Connected World easier to live in and
more enjoyable to experience.
